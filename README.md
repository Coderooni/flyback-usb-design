# Flyback USB Design
## Description
This repository contains files and folders that make up the switch mode power supply (SMPS). It is designed for charging smartphones with a power rating of 20W total. This supply is a dual output USB charger, providing 5V and 2A at each output.

## Instructions
To view the schematic and PCB layout, make sure to install KiCad (I'm using v6.0) and open the files with the _kicad_sch_ and _kicad_pcb_ extensions respectively.

## Future Work
As this is still an initial design, simulation tests are pending before moving forward with PCB manufacturing and assembly.
